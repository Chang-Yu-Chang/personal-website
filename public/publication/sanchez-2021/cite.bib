 abstract = {Directed evolution is a form of artificial selection that has
been used for decades to find biomolecules and organisms with new
or enhanced functional traits. Directed evolution can be
conceptualized as a guided exploration of the genotype-phenotype
map, where genetic variants with desirable phenotypes are first
selected and then mutagenized to search the genotype space for an
even better mutant. In recent years, the idea of applying
artificial selection to microbial communities has gained
momentum. In this article, we review the main limitations of
artificial selection when applied to large and diverse
collectives of asexually dividing microbes and discuss how the
tools of directed evolution may be deployed to engineer
communities from the top down. We conceptualize directed
evolution of microbial communities as a guided exploration of an
ecological structure-function landscape and propose practical
guidelines for navigating these ecological landscapes.},
