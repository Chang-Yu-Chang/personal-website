 abstract = {Directed evolution has been used for decades to engineer
biological systems at or below the organismal level. Above the
organismal level, a small number of studies have attempted to
artificially select microbial ecosystems, with uneven and
generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of
artificial ecosystem selection is limited, particularly for large
assemblages of asexual organisms, and we know little about
designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. Here, we
have developed a flexible modelling framework that allows us to
systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any
arbitrary set of communities and selected functions. By
artificially selecting hundreds of in silico microbial
metacommunities under identical conditions, we first show that
the main breeding methods used to date, which do not necessarily
let communities reach their ecological equilibrium, are
outperformed by a simple screen of sufficiently mature
communities. We then identify a range of alternative directed
evolution strategies that, particularly when applied in
combination, are well suited for the top-down engineering of
large, diverse and stable microbial consortia. Our results
emphasize that directed evolution allows an ecological
structure-function landscape to be navigated in search of
dynamically stable and ecologically resilient communities with
desired quantitative attributes.},
