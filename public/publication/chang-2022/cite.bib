  abstract = "Microbial communities are highly diverse, and understanding the
              factors that promote and modulate this diversity is a major area
              of research in microbial ecology. Recent work has proposed a
              reductionist perspective to microbial coexistence, where pairwise
              coexistence between strains in isolation is required for their
              coexistence in a more complex community. In this view, species
              exclusion in pairwise co-culture would preclude their coexistence
              in a more complex community too. An alternative view is that
              coexistence is a more complex property of the entire community,
              requiring the presence of additional community members. If this
              view were correct, competitive exclusion in pairwise co-culture
              would not necessarily preclude species coexistence in more
              complex community contexts. Empirically testing these alternative
              hypotheses is complicated by the intractably high microbial
              diversity of most natural communities, and the challenges of
              reconstituting every pair of coexisting species under the exact
              same habitat where their community of origin was assembled. To
              address this challenge, we have experimentally reconstituted all
              possible pairwise co-cultures between stably coexisting species
              from 13 different, low diversity microbial enrichment
              communities, which had previously been assembled in a
              well-controlled synthetic habitat. We find that, when isolated
              from the rest of their community members, most species pairs fail
              to coexist. This result highlights the importance of community
              context for microbial coexistence, and indicates that pairwise
              exclusion may not reflect the ability of species to coexist in
              more complex, multispecies ecosystems. \#\#\# Competing Interest
