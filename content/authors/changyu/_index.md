I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Corlett Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.com/) investigating the evolutionary potential of plant hosts and the ecology of their associated microbial communities. 

Before growing the bean sprouts, My previous work in graduate school, under the guidance of [Alvaro Sanchez](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com/), focused on understanding how microbial communities assemble and evolve through a blend of experimental and computational approaches. For more details on my research, you can check out [my past works](/publication).

You can find insights into digital tools I enjoy using for streamlining tasks, for instance, [a data-driven CV using R pagedown](/blog/2019-11-03-data-driven-cv/) and [the digital tools for a graduate student](/blog/2020-08-11-digital-toolset).
