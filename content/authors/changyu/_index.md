I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Corlett Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.com/) investigating the evolutionary genomics of plant hosts and the ecology of their symbiotic microbes. When I am not coding, I grow beans and rhizobia in the lab.

My previous work in graduate school, under the guidance of [Alvaro Sanchez](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com/), focused on understanding how microbial communities assemble and evolve through a blend of experimental and computational approaches.

I enjoy using digital tools for streamlining tasks, for instance, a data-driven CV using R pagedown (I now change to Typst! See my cv on the menu) and the digital tools for a graduate student.
