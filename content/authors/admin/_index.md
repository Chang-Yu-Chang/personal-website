I am finishing my PhD supervised by [Alvaro Sanchez ](http://www.sanchezlaboratory.com/). I am interested in predicting how microbial communities assemble and evolve. See my [past works](/publication/).

I like coding and digital tools that cut off tedious repetitive tasks and make life easy. For example, I enjoyed learning how to [make this website using blogdown](/2018-03-08-how-to-build-up-this-website/) and [data-driven CV using pagedown](/2019-11-03-build-my-own-data-driven-cv/).
