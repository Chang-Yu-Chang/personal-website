abstract: For microbiome biology to become a more predictive science, we
               must identify which descriptive features of microbial
               communities are reproducible and predictable, which are not,and
               why. We address this question by experimentally studying
               parallelism and convergence in microbial community assembly in
               replicate glucose-limited habitats. Here, we show that the
               previously observed family-level convergence in these habitats
               reflects a reproducible metabolic organization, where the ratio
               of the dominant metabolic groups can be explained from a simple
               resource-partitioning model. In turn, taxonomic divergence among
               replicate communities arises from multistability in population
               dynamics. Multistability can also lead to alternative functional
               states in closed ecosystems but not in metacommunities. Our
               findings empirically illustrate how the evolutionary
               conservation of quantitative metabolic traits, multistability,
               and the inherent stochasticity of population dynamics, may all
               conspire to generate the patterns of reproducibility and
               variability at different levels of organization that are
               commonplace in microbial community assembly. communities.
