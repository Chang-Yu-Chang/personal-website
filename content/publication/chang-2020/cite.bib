 abstract = {Artificial selection is a promising approach to manipulate
microbial communities. Here, we report the outcome of two
artificial selection experiments at the microbial community
level. Both used ``propagule'' selection strategies, whereby the
best-performing communities are used as the inocula to form a new
generation of communities. Both experiments were contrasted to a
random selection control. The first experiment used a defined set
of strains as the starting inoculum, and the function under
selection was the amylolytic activity of the consortia. The
second experiment used multiple soil communities as the starting
inocula, and the function under selection was the communities'
cross-feeding potential. In both experiments, the selected
communities reached a higher mean function than the control. In
the first experiment, this was caused by a decline in function of
the control, rather than an improvement of the selected line. In
the second experiment, this response was fueled by the large
initial variance in function across communities, and stopped when
the top-performing community ``fixed'' in the metacommunity. Our
results are in agreement with basic expectations from breeding
theory, pointing to some of the limitations of community-level
selection experiments that can inform the design of future
studies.},
