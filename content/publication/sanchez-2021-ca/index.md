abstract: Directed evolution is a form of artificial selection that has been used
  for decades to find biomolecules and organisms with new or enhanced functional traits.
  Directed evolution can be conceptualized as a guided exploration of the genotype-phenotype
  map, where genetic variants with desirable phenotypes are first selected and then
  mutagenized to search the genotype space for an even better mutant. In recent years,
  the idea of applying artificial selection to microbial communities has gained momentum.
  In this article, we review the main limitations of artificial selection when applied
  to large and diverse collectives of asexually dividing microbes and discuss how
  the tools of directed evolution may be deployed to engineer communities from the
  top down. We conceptualize directed evolution of microbial communities as a guided
  exploration of an ecological structure-function landscape and propose practical
  guidelines for navigating these ecological landscapes.
