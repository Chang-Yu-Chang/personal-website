abstract: Directed evolution has been used for decades to engineer biological systems
  at or below the organismal level. Above the organismal level, a small number of
  studies have attempted to artificially select microbial ecosystems, with uneven
  and generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of artificial ecosystem
  selection is limited, particularly for large assemblages of asexual organisms, and
  we know little about designing efficient methods to direct their evolution. Here,
  we have developed a flexible modelling framework that allows us to systematically
  probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary set of communities and selected
  functions. By artificially selecting hundreds of in silico microbial metacommunities
  under identical conditions, we first show that the main breeding methods used to
  date, which do not necessarily let communities reach their ecological equilibrium,
  are outperformed by a simple screen of sufficiently mature communities. We then
  identify a range of alternative directed evolution strategies that, particularly
  when applied in combination, are well suited for the top-down engineering of large,
  diverse and stable microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution
  allows an ecological structure-function landscape to be navigated in search of dynamically
  stable and ecologically resilient communities with desired quantitative attributes.
