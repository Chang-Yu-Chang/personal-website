 abstract = {To develop a quantitative theory that can predict how microbiomes
assemble, and how they respond to perturbations, we must identify
which descriptive features of microbial communities are
reproducible and predictable, which are unpredictable, and why.
The emergent metagenomic structure of communities is often
quantitatively convergent in similar habitats, with highly
similar fractions of the metagenome being devoted to the same
metabolic pathways. By contrast, the species-level taxonomic
composition is often highly variable even in replicate
environments. The mechanisms behind these patterns are not yet
understood. By studying the self-assembly of hundreds of
communities in replicate, synthetic habitats, we show that the
reproducibility of microbial community assembly reflects an
emergent metabolic structure, which is quantitatively predictable
from first-principles, genome-scale metabolic models. Taxonomic
variability within functional groups arises through
multistability in population dynamics, and the species-level
community composition is predictably governed by the mutual
competitive exclusion of two sub-dominant strains. Our findings
provide a mechanistic bridge between microbial community
structure at different levels of organization, and show that the
evolutionary conservation of metabolic traits, both in terms of
growth responses and niches constructed, can be leveraged to
quantitatively predict the taxonomic and metabolic structure of
microbial communities.},
