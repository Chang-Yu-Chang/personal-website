abstract: Artificial selection is a promising approach to manipulate microbial communities.
  Here, we report the outcome of two artificial selection experiments at the microbial
  community level. Both used ``propagule'' selection strategies, whereby the best-performing
  communities are used as the inocula to form a new generation of communities. Both
  experiments were contrasted to a random selection control. The first experiment
  used a defined set of strains as the starting inoculum, and the function under selection
  was the amylolytic activity of the consortia. The second experiment used multiple
  soil communities as the starting inocula, and the function under selection was the
  communities' cross-feeding potential. In both experiments, the selected communities
  reached a higher mean function than the control. In the first experiment, this was
  caused by a decline in function of the control, rather than an improvement of the
  selected line. In the second experiment, this response was fueled by the large initial
  variance in function across communities, and stopped when the top-performing community
  ``fixed'' in the metacommunity. Our results are in agreement with basic expectations
  from breeding theory, pointing to some of the limitations of community-level selection
  experiments that can inform the design of future studies.
