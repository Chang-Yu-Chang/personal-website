              is a critical aspiration in ecology. Past work on microbial
              coexistence has largely focused on species pairs, but it is
              unclear whether pairwise coexistence in isolation is required for
              coexistence in a multispecies community. To address this
              question, we conducted hundreds of pairwise competition
              experiments among the stably coexisting members of 12 different
              enrichment communities in vitro. To determine the outcomes of
              these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis
              pipeline to quantify species abundances. We found that
              competitive exclusion was the most common outcome, and it was
              strongly hierarchical and transitive. Because many species that
              coexist within a stable multispecies community fail to coexist in
              pairwise co-culture under identical conditions, we concluded that
              multispecies coexistence is an emergent phenomenon. This work
              highlights the importance of community context for understanding
              the origins of coexistence in complex ecosystems.",
